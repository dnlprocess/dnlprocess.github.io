    "instructions": "1. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Cook pasta until just al dente, reserving 1 cup pasta water before draining.\n\n2. While pasta cooks, heat olive oil in a large pan over medium-low heat. Add sliced garlic and cook slowly until golden (not brown), about 3-4 minutes.\n\n3. Add red pepper flakes, cook 30 seconds.\n\n4. Add drained pasta and 1/4 cup pasta water. Toss vigorously to emulsify.\n\n5. Add parsley, adjust salt, and serve immediately with parmesan if desired.",
