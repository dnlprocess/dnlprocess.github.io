My interests lie in Mathematical Physics and Enumerative Geometry.\nOutside of math, I enjoy hiking/photography and cooking, and when I can, I trade the chalkboard and psets for climbing chalk and bouldering problems.\nOn this site, you’ll find my photography, mathematical writings, recipes, and general musings.",
