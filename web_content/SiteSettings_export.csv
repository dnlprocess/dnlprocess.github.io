"Portfolio","I am a landscape photographer based in the Pacific Northwest, drawn to the quiet, contemplative moments found in nature.

My work explores the intersection of light, form, and atmosphere—seeking to capture the ephemeral quality of wilderness spaces that exist beyond the reach of everyday experience.

Through careful composition and patience, I aim to create images that invite stillness and reflection.","hello@example.com","@photographer","Pacific Northwest","698ab57096fb92772053a237","2026-02-10T04:34:56.954000","2026-02-10T04:34:56.954000","698ab4c2a53a66660afe6db3","danielthemanyl3@gmail.com","false"
