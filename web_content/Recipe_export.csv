"Simple Pasta Aglio e Olio","pasta-aglio-olio","A classic Roman pasta that proves the best dishes often have the fewest ingredients.","https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1621996346565-e3dbc646d9a9?w=1200","5 min","15 min","2","- 200g spaghetti
- 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- 1/3 cup good olive oil
- 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
- Fresh parsley, chopped
- Parmesan (optional)
- Salt to taste","1. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Cook pasta until just al dente, reserving 1 cup pasta water before draining.

2. While pasta cooks, heat olive oil in a large pan over medium-low heat. Add sliced garlic and cook slowly until golden (not brown), about 3-4 minutes.

3. Add red pepper flakes, cook 30 seconds.

4. Add drained pasta and 1/4 cup pasta water. Toss vigorously to emulsify.

5. Add parsley, adjust salt, and serve immediately with parmesan if desired.","The key is cooking the garlic low and slow—golden, never brown. The pasta water helps create a silky sauce.","true","698ab772e7f1f783467ff435","2026-02-10T04:43:30.748000","2026-02-10T04:43:30.748000","698ab4c2a53a66660afe6db3","danielthemanyl3@gmail.com","false"
